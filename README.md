# Front-End Take-Home Coding Challenge

## Overview

Build a simple product catalog using data from [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/products). The user interface should allow:

1. Selecting a category to filter products.
2. Filtering products by a price range.
3. Searching products by title.
4. Combining multiple filters at the same time.

You are free to use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”no frameworks are required. The focus is on your ability to structure your code, manage state, and implement filtering logic.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality

1. **Fetch and Display Products**
   - Fetch all products from:  
     `GET https://fakestoreapi.com/products`
   - Display the products in a grid or list layout.

2. **Category Selection**
   - Extract unique categories from the product list (e.g., `electronics`, `jewelery`, `men's clothing`, `women's clothing`).
   - Provide a way for users to select a category and only show products in that category.

3. **Price Range Filter**
   - Allow users to set a minimum and maximum price.
   - Only show products whose prices fall within this range.

4. **Search by Title**
   - Provide a search input that filters products by title substring.

5. **Combined Filters**
   - All filters (category, price range, search) should work together.
   - For example, if a category and a price range are selected, show only products matching both criteria, and also apply search if the user enters a search term.

### Optional Enhancements

- **Sorting**: Allow users to sort filtered products by price or title.
- **Product Details**: Clicking on a product can show more detailed information (e.g., in a modal).

### Technical Details

- Use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks are required.
- Fetch data from the provided API.
- Structure your code logically (e.g., separate data fetching from rendering, etc.).
- Handle loading states and errors (e.g., show a message if the API request fails).

### Testing

- Include at least one test (it can be a very simple unit test in a separate file or a code snippet). Explain how to run it in the `README.md`.

### Documentation

- Include a `README.md` with:
  - Instructions on how to run your solution locally.
  - A brief explanation of your approach.
  
### Accessibility & UX

- Aim for accessible markup (e.g., semantic HTML, proper labels).
- Provide a responsive design that looks good on various screen sizes.
- Show a loading message while fetching products.
- If no products match filters, show a user-friendly message.
